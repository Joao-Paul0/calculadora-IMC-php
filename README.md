# PHP Activity and Writing to Files

Building an HTML form, which is served by the PHP development server. This form should contain fields for the user to enter Name, Weight and Height to calculate BMI (just like in the first bimester challenge project). When the user enters this data, the system must calculate the BMI value via PHP on the server and must save the data in a file called 'IMC.csv' in the same directory as your project. After saving this data in the file, the system should forward the user to a success page.

The file contents were saved as follows:

NAME; WEIGHT; HEIGHT; BMI; DATE

# Run server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
